# redux-router-state

Store router state in Redux and route via redux

## Goals:

* Storing router state in redux is a design principle, not an after thought
* `Router.go()`, `Router.setParams()`, etc dispatch actions to the redux store.
* `pushState, replaceState etc fire on changes to *redux* state (i.e. time travel works great out the box).
* The (optional) react <Router> component subscribes to redux router state for changes
* See "Related Projects" at the bottom of the README for (dis)similar alternatives

## Setup and Pure-JS (no react usage)

*See below for React helpers*

```js
import { combineReducers, createStore } from 'redux';
import Router from 'redux-router-state';

// Add your routes BEFORE creating your Store with the reducer
// This step could be done for via the React helper, see below.
Router.add('home', '/');
Router.add('issue_id', '/issues/:id');

// Include Router.reducer when setting up your reducers
const reducers = combineReducers({
  route: Router.reducer
});

// However you usually create your store
const Store = createStore(reducers, {},
  window.devToolsExtension && window.devToolsExtension()
);

// Initialize the Router with your store.
Router.init(Store);
```

State:

```js
{
  // http://x.com/issues/1/?action=edit#mode=markdown
  Router: {
    name: 'issue_id',
    pathname: '/issues/1/'
    params: {
      id: 1
    },
    query: {
      action: 'edit'
    },
    hash: {
      mode: 'markdown'
    }
  }
}
```

## React Helpers

**Optional react-router inspired config:**

```js
const App = () => (
  <Provider store={Store} />
    <Router>
      <Route name="home" path="/">
        <div>
          <h1>Welcome home!</h1>
          <div>
            You can put simple things inline but using component=
            is better (and we might stop supporting this)
          </div>
        </div>
      </Route>

      <Route name="issues" path="/issues/:id" component={ShowIssue} />

      <Route name="users" path="/users" component={ShowUsers}
        mapRouteToProps={route => {asc: route.queryParams.asc}}>
    </Router>
  </Provider>
);

const ShowIssue({id}) => (
  <h1>Issue #{id}</h1>
);

const ShowUsers({asc}) => (
  <h1>Users ({props.asc?"Asceending":"Descending")</h1>
);

```

**Creating links:**

```js
<Link to="issues" params={{id: 1}}>Issue #1</Link>
```

**Accessing route info:**

By default, only the route params are passed down as individual props, to avoid unnecessary re-rendering.  You can override this with the `mapRouteToProps` attribute (as above), and/or, use the `connectRouter` HOC on individual compoents that works pretty much how you'd expect:

`connectRouter([optionalMappingFunction], Component)`

```js
const showIssue = routerConnect(
  // optional mapping function, provides 'id' as the only prop
  (route) => { id: route.params.id },

  // display component, could be an existing constant
  (id) => ( <h1>Issue #{id}</h1> )
);
```

// Without the optional mapping function, a "route" prop is given, with the
// entire router state.  This may lead to unnecessary re-rendering.
```

Like `react-redux`'s `connect` (which we use), it assumes a `<Provider>` ancestor.

### Related projects:

* Similar to [universal-redux-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/universal-redux-router)
  but works in a slightly different (and imho simpler) way, i.e. no need to define your
  own reducers for each part of every route.

* Dissimilar to [react-router-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux) and
  react-router which stores state in a hidden redux store just for timetravel.
